With &quot;alg_pknot_shapes.gap&quot; we carry over the idea of shape abstraction to pseudoknots. We define the same five levels of abstraction, but the shape strings will have a slightly different look. To retain the crossing stem indication by special types of brackets, we now use normal parentheses <code>( )</code> for nested sub-structures, square brackets <code>[ ]</code> for alpha helices, curly brackets <code>{ }</code> for beta helices and angle brackets <code>&lt; &gt;</code> for gamma helices of pseudoknots.
You will find the five &quot;normal&quot; algebras plus a unifying <code>alg_pknot_shapeX</code> version.
