&quot;Algebras/Shapes/alg_hishapes.gap&quot;: Some applications require a position specific type of shapes (see <a href="http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/early/2012/10/24/rna.033548.112.short">Abstract folding space analysis based on helices</a>). Jiabin Huang defined three level of position specific shapes, called helix center shapes (hishapes). The center of a helix is the middle position of the unpaired loop region. For odd regions, the position can be x.5.
<ul>
<li>algebra &quot;alg_hishape_h&quot; accounts only for centers in hairpin loops.</li>
<li>algebra &quot;alg_hishape_m&quot; records centers for multiloops in addition to the hairpin loop centers.</li>
<li>algebra &quot;alg_hishape_b&quot; extends &quot;alg_hishape_m&quot; by also recording centers for bulges and internal loops.</li>
