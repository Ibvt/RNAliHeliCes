&quot;Algebras/Shapes/alg_shapes_rope.gap&quot; is identical to <a href="?id=alg_shapes.gap">Algebras/Shapes/alg_shapes.gap</a>, but uses the <code>Rope</code> data type instead of <code>shape</code>. This is useful to test hash key generation or develop further shape levels with more than the three characters.
