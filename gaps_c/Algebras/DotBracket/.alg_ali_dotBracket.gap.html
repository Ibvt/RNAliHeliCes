&quot;Algebras/DotBracket/alg_ali_dotBracket.gap&quot; is a special version of <a href="?id=alg_dotBracket.gap">Algebras/DotBracket/alg_dotBracket.gap</a> for alignments as input instead of a single sequence. The only difference is the type for the alphabet, i.e. the terminal parser. <!-- TODO: It would be nice to just exchange the type via a type synonym, but currently GAP-C is not able to.-->
