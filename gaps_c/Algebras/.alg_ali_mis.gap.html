&quot;Algebras/alg_ali_mis.gap&quot; computes the &quot;most informative sequence&quot; (Freyhult et al 2004). Elements in alignment columns with frequency greater than the background frequency are projected into <a href="http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/misc/MPsrch/InfoIUPAC.html">IUPAC notation</a>. Columns where gaps are over-represented are in lower case.
The real magic is externalized in the file <a href="?id=alifold.hh">alifold.hh</a>.
