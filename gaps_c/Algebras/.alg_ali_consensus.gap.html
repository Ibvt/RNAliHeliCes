&quot;Algebras/alg_ali_consensus.gap&quot;: given an alignment, this algebra computes a consensus sequence. It simply is the most frequent character at each position. Should several different characters appear with maximal frequency they are sorted according to the GAP-L internal enumeration construct, which currently is <code>enum base_t { N_BASE, A_BASE, C_BASE, G_BASE, U_BASE, GAP_BASE };</code>, and the first is selected.
