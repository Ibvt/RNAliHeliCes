<p>Binaries compiled with BGAP-C are not meant to be ready to ship programs. The system is not restricted to RNA problems; although this package only deals with them. Thus, compiled programs are equipped with a very generic front end (the *_main.cc files). In order to pass RNA specific command line arguments (e.g. usage of lonely base-pairs) into the computation, we replace some components of the generated C++ code previous to compilation with g++. This task is automated by the Perl script <a href="?id=addRNAoptions.pl">Misc/Applications/addRNAoptions.pl</a> and can be applied via <code>perl Misc/Applications/addRNAoptions.pl out.mf</code>.
<br/>&quot;rnaoptions.hh&quot; replaces the BGAP built-in &quot;rtlib/generic_opts.hh&quot; file.</p>
<p>Since this extension of the command line parameters only matters if you want to deploy an application, but not if you are in the process of designing a new BGAP program, the file <a href="?id=rnaoptions_defaults.hh">Extensions/rnaoptions_defaults.hh</a> contains default values for all additional RNA parameters.</p>
<p>Depending on your instances not all arguments will have influence on the results, e.g. if you deal with nested folding <code>pkissinit</code> (the initialization penalty for a kissing hairpin) can be set but won't change anything.</p>
