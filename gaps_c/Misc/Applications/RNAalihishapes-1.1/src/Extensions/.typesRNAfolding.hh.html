<p>Many algebras in this package need special answer types. Most of them are defined in &quot;typesRNAfolding.hh&quot;, although there is the possibility to do so within BGAP-L code. But for these cases the generated functions are to general. We want to add some special functions computing on these new data types, as well, like <code>mk_tuple</code> or <code>wc_comp</code> for computation of <a href="?id=alg_pfunc_macrostate.gap">partition function</a> for <a href="?id=gra_macrostate.gap">macrostate grammar</a>. This way, we can also define identity for those types, which becomes important for classification algebras, when a hash is used (<code>hashable_value</code> functions) or representation of the results (<code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> functions).</p>
<p>The end of the file, contains functions for stochastic backtracing. To find the right alternative with corresponding probability, the probability weight must be expressed with a single value (of type &quot;double&quot;). In the macrostate case, this means we have to sum over all four separate components (<code>PfanswerToDoubleAll</code>).
