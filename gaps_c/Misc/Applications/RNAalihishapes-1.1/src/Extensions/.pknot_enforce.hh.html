&quot;pknot_enforce.hh&quot; provides an answer type, functions for backtracing and the overlay idea of pKiss for a special classification algebra for pseudoknots. There are the four hard coded classes &quot;nested structure&quot;, &quot;H-type pseudoknot&quot;, &quot;K-type pseudoknot&quot; and &quot;H- and K-type pseudoknot&quot;. You can use these enforced folding classes for a comparison between say the energetically best H-type structure and the best nested structure. This gives you a first impression of the likelihood that the input sequence forms a pseudoknot.
