	A thermodynamic matcher (TDM) is a specialized RNA folding program. Instead of spanning the complete search space of general RNA folding, a TDM spans only a defined subset of it. This subset might be defined via a graphical description (see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/13/i392">Locomotif: From Graphical Motif Description to RNA Motif Search</a>) or via a shape string (see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/5/632.short">Faster computation of exact RNA shape probabilities</a>).

	&quot;Grammars/gra_tdm.gap&quot; is for the later one. Given a shape string of a specific shape level, we have to generate a specialized grammar out of one of the four prototype grammars <a href="?id=gra_nodangle.gap">Grammars/gra_nodangle.gap</a> <a href="?id=gra_overdangle.gap">Grammars/gra_overdangle.gap</a> <a href="?id=gra_microstate.gap">Grammars/gra_microstate.gap</a> or <a href="?id=gra_macrostate.gap">Grammars/gra_macrostate.gap</a>. This process itself is done with a GAP-L program. So one could say a GAP program generates a GAP program. Due to modularity it only generates the grammar, algebras, signatures and instances could simply be re-used.

	Actually, &quot;Grammars/gra_tdm.gap&quot; is not a single grammar, but six of them. They all use <a href="?id=sig_tdm.gap">Signatures/sig_tdm.gap</a>, but not all functions in all shape levels or with all prototype grammars. 
	<ul class="grammars">
		<li>&quot;gra_shape5&quot;: level 5 is the most easiest to parse, because of the highest abstraction level. All four prototype grammars get along with the same kind of parsing a level 5 shape string.</li>
		<li>&quot;gra_shape4u3&quot;: the difference between level 5 and level 4 is only the types of interruptions of a stem. In level 4, also internal loop interruptions have to be expressed, thus we need one additional rule in this grammar, namely the <code>helixinterrupt</code> function. Fortunately, the difference to level 3 is even more easy. It manifests only in the way the specialized grammar is created, but not on parsing the given shape string. Thus, there is no difference between 4 and 3!</li>
		<li>&quot;gra_shape2&quot;: again, only the alternatives to interrupt a stem increase. Instead of the <code>helixinterrupt</code>, we now have <code>leftbulge</code>, <code>rightbulge</code> and <code>internalloop</code>.</li>
		<li>&quot;gra_shape1&quot;: in level 1, we also account for unpaired bases outside of stems, i.e. between every two (multiloop-)stems and at 5' and 3' ends. This is reflected by the functions <code>sadd</code>, <code>mlsadd</code> and <code>unpaired</code>
			<ul class="grammars">
				<li>&quot;gra_shape1_microstate&quot;: the <a href="gra_microstate.gap">microstate</a> prototype grammar is semantically ambiguous regarding Vienna-Dot-Bracket strings, i.e. a (multiloop-)stem can formed by four different ways, dependent on dangling neighboring bases. But a dangling base is an unpaired one and must be represented by an underscore <code>_</code>. On the other hand, this underscore could also result from a &quot;real&quot; stretch of unpaired bases. The grammar must take care of all these situations.</li>
				<li>&quot;gra_shape1_macrostate&quot;: here we have the same problem as with &quot;gra_shape1_microstate&quot;, but the <a href="gra_macrostate.gap">macrostate</a> prototype avoids the ambiguity. Again, we need the grammar to ensure the right parsing of the given shape string.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	<ul>
	Please note that shape level 1 grammars are syntactically ambiguous, while all other grammars are not.
