A much more elaborate grammar to enumerate the same structures as <a href="?id=gra_nodangle.gap">Grammars/gra_nodangle.gap</a>, but - in principle - in an semantically unambiguous way regarding the Vienna-Dot-Bracket notation. Practically, it violates Bellman's principle of optimality when used for MFE computations, but which delivers correct results for a probabilistic analysis by using a four component answer tuple.
