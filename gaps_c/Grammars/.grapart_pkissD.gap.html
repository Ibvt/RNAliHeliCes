<p>This is a part of <a href="?id=gra_pknot_microstate.gap">Grammars/gra_pknot_microstate.gap</a>. It is responsible for <i>Strategy D</i> computation of kissing hairpins for the program pKiss.</p>
<p><i>Strategy D</i> is mainly for debugging. It is the direct application of the canonicalization rules known from <i>pknotsRG</i>, thus it has a very slow runtime of O(n<sup>6</sup>). Compared to strategies A to C and regarding the canonization concept, Strategy D is the only non-heuristically one. Thus, it returns the best results, but its runtime is often unaffordable.</p>
