<p>This is a part of <a href="?id=gra_pknot_microstate.gap">Grammars/gra_pknot_microstate.gap</a>. It is responsible for <i>Strategy C</i> computation of kissing hairpins for the program pKiss.</p>
<p>Since larger memory is often a harder problem than longer runtime, we alter Strategy B to trade memory for runtime. <i>Strategy C</i> avoids the extra storage required by Strategy B by re-computing the necessary information on demand. Coupling running indices k and l reduces the runtime by one dimension.</p>
