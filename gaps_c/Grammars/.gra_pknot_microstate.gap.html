<p>&quot;Grammars/gra_pknot_microstate.gap&quot; is an extension of the normal folding grammar by pseudoknots. In principal, pseudoknot prediction with an thermodynamic energy model is NP-hard in general. Thus, most programs focus only on a small subset of pseudoknot classes. A further complication is, that pseudoknots cannot be represented as trees, thus we have to &quot;hack&quot; Bellman's GAP to be able to deal with them. &quot;Grammars/gra_pknot_microstate.gap&quot; contains the most frequently known pseudoknots of <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg/">pknotsRG</a> (H-type pseudoknots) and <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/">pKiss</a> (K-type pseudoknots). It uses the microstate way to cope with dangling bases. Pseudoknot components are outsourced into the grammar fragments <a href="?id=grapart_pkinnars.gap">Grammars/grapart_pkinnars.gap</a> for the free folding parts, <a href="?id=grapart_pknotsrg.gap">Grammars/grapart_pknotsrg.gap</a> for the index hacking for pknotsRG knots, and <a href="?id=grapart_pkissA.gap">Grammars/grapart_pkissA.gap</a> for free folding parts and strategy A for knots of type pKiss. See <a href="http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/pkiss_paper.pdf">Prediction of RNA secondary structure including kissing hairpin motifs.</a>
There are also grammar fragments <a href="?id=grapart_pkissB.gap">Grammars/grapart_pkissB.gap</a>, <a href="?id=grapart_pkissC.gap">Grammars/grapart_pkissC.gap</a> and <a href="?id=grapart_pkissD.gap">Grammars/grapart_pkissD.gap</a> for the remaining three strategies of <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/">pKiss</a>, plus <a href="?id=grapart_pkissBC.gap">Grammars/grapart_pkissBC.gap</a>, which contains some rules used by strategies B and C.</p>

&quot;Grammars/gra_pknot_microstate.gap&quot; serves as prototype grammar for <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/locomotif/">Locomotif</a>.It is a graphical editor, letting you literally draw your favorite RNA motif, and converts this drawing into a highly specialized grammar, which lo longer enumerates the complete folding space, but only those parts defined by your drawing.
