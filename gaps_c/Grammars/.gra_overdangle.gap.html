&quot;Grammars/gra_overdangle.gap&quot; essentially is a copy of <a href="?id=gra_nodangle.gap">Grammars/gra_nodangle.gap</a>, but we want to keep names clear. The difference stems from different <a href="?id=alg_mfe.gap">MFE</a> or <a href="?id=alg_pfunc.gap">partition function algebras</a>, not different grammars. And those differences are realized by overloading the few according functions in the main GAP-L file (&quot;overdangle.gap&quot;), not by different algebra files.
