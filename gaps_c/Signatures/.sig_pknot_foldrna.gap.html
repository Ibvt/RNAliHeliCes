We provide a separate signature for RNA predictions including pseudoknots (for the two classes of <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pknotsrg/">pknotsRG</a> and <a href="http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/pkiss/">pKiss</a>). Furthermore, to handle dangling bases, we need a mechanism to address the inward partners of the terminal pseudoknot stems. In our case, this mechanism is an answer tuple for some of the signature functions. Thus, besides the normal &quot;sort&quot; <code>comp</code>, we need a second &quot;sort&quot;, called <code>compKnot</code>.
