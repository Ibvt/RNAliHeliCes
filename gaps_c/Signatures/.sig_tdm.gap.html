	A thermodynamic matcher (TDM) is a specialized RNA folding program. Instead of spanning the complete search space of general RNA folding, a TDM spans only a defined subset of it. This subset might be defined via a graphical description (see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/23/13/i392">Locomotif: From Graphical Motif Description to RNA Motif Search</a>) or via a shape string (see <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/5/632.short">Faster computation of exact RNA shape probabilities</a>).
</p>
<p>
	&quot;Signatures/sig_tdm.gap&quot; is for the later one. Given a shape string of a specific shape level, we have to generate a specialized grammar out of one of the four prototype grammars <a href="?id=gra_nodangle.gap">Grammars/gra_nodangle.gap</a> <a href="?id=gra_overdangle.gap">Grammars/gra_overdangle.gap</a> <a href="?id=gra_microstate.gap">Grammars/gra_microstate.gap</a> or <a href="?id=gra_macrostate.gap">Grammars/gra_macrostate.gap</a>. This process itself is done with a GAP-L program. So one could say a GAP program generates a GAP program. Due to modularity it only generates the grammar, algebras, signatures and instances could simply be re-used.

<p>
	&quot;Signatures/sig_tdm.gap&quot; is ready to cope with all four prototype grammars in all five shape levels, but not all functions will be needed for each specific grammar / level combination. See the comments in the file itself for further details. Note the special function <code>convert</code>, which is not part of the shape string parsing process, but serves to add header and footer to the generated grammar.
