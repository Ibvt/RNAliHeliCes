Quickstart
------------
1. Read deps and install the dependent compilers and packages
2. Type
     sudo apt install libboost-dev libboost-all-dev 
     ./configure
     make
     make install
   to configure, make and install RNAHeliCes, HiPath and HiTed
   Notes:
     - If there are any linking problems after installing, please check if /usr/local/lib is contained in the environmental variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
     - src/libs/libRNA.a contains all Vienna package routines, this may be system dependent. If so, please reload this from Vienna RNA Package.
3. Type './src/RNAHeliCes ./examples/collosoma_slrna.seq' to calculate hishapes of the example described on the paper.
4. Type './src/HiPath -h' to get help for calculating energy barriers of an energy landscape.
   For example, type './src/HiPath -f ./examples/switches_4.faa -k 40' and 
                     './src/HiPath -f ./examples/riboswitches.faa -k 20' to run the examples benchmarked on our paper.
                type './src/HiPath -f ./examples/collosoma_slrna.fa -a' to calculate folding pathways from all hishapes to all hishapes.
5. Type './src/HiTed -h' to get help for calculating minimum Hishape based Tree edit distance.
   For example, type './src/HiTed ./examples/riboswitches.fas -t 1 -r 1' to run an example.
6. HiEAPath is under ./modified_Softwares/RNAEAPath/
   Type 'cd ./modified_Softwares/RNAEAPath/' and './HiEAPath SL.faa' to run an example
7. kinetic analysis based on HiEAPath is implemented as an option --method=H in ./modified_Softwares/Treekin-0.3.1
